This postgraduate course has been used as in-service training by a number of UK and global companies (e.g. mobile telecoms). While one naturally thinks of mobile phone design as belonging to \'telecommunications\', there are considerable audio engineering challenges in designing good quality sound from the small transducers used in confined spaces, often in the presence of considerable background noise. Also, increasing markets exist for sophisticated audio systems in the home (smart speakers), at work (virtual and augmented environments) and in transport (car audio or &#39;infotainment&#39;).</p>\n\n<p>The audio acoustics industry is diverse. It includes major firms with \'core\' audio-related market share such as Philips, Sony, Dolby, B&amp;O and KEF. Many other businesses employ specialists in acoustics from Salford: Apple, Bentley, JLR to name a few. Building design and architectural acoustics needs specialist engineering consultants looking at room configurations and surface treatments, noise ingress and egress, sound reinforcement system design and so on, and a very wide variety of companies (Arup Acoustics are one large example in our area) employ graduates from our courses. Students also go on to study for a higher degree by research, here at Salford or elsewhere.</p>\n\n<h3>Career Prospects</h3>\n\n<p>Acousticians with engineering, science and mathematical skills are currently in short supply, and Salford MSc Audio Acoustics graduates are in a very strong position in the jobs market. The University of Salford has over 25 years&#39; experience of placing graduates in key audio and acoustic industries carrying out consultancy, research, development and design. These include well-known companies such as Apple, Dolby and the BBC, and with almost every major acoustic consultancy in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Typically our graduates go into:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/careers/index.php?content=acoustics-audio-research-jobs\">Acoustics and audio engineering research</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/careers/index.php?content=acoustic-consultancy-jobs\">Acoustics and noise consultancy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/careers/index.php?content=broadcast-engineering-jobs\">Broadcast engineering</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/careers/index.php?content=entertainment-audio-jobs\">Entertainment audio and sound system engineering</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/careers/index.php?content=loudpeaker-audio-design-jobs\">Loudspeaker and audio system design</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/careers/index.php?content=noise-engineering-jobs\">Product sound</a></li></ul>\n\n<p>In 2013, A survey of 500 of our acoustic and audio alumni found 1 in 5 of our graduates live outside the UK and 45% are in Senior jobs or are Directors.
